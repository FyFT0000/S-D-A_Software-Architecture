Software Architecture
    Ways architectures are represented, both in UML and other visual tools. Most common architectures, their qualities, and tradeoffs.


3.1.1 – Architecture Overview and Process
Software architecture is the fundamental design of an entire software system. It defines what elements are included in the system, what function each element has, and how each element relates to one another. It is the big picture or overall structure of the whole system—how everything works together.
_   It follows that to design a software system, a software architect has to take many factors into consideration:
    _the purpose of the system,
    _the audience or users of the system,
    _the qualities that are of most importance to users, and
    _where the system will run.
_   Software architecture is important, particularly for large systems. If there is a clear design of the overall system from the start, there is a solid basis for developers to follow. Each developer will then know what needs to be implemented and how things are related to meet desired needs efficiently. This avoids conflicts, duplication, and ad hoc unnecessary work.
_   Some advantages of software architecture include:
    _higher productivity for the software team, as a well-defined structure helps to coordinate work, implement individual features, or guide discussions on potential issues.
    _improved evolution for the software, since design principles are applied to make changes easier to accomplish or defects easier to find.
    _enhanced quality in the software by carefully considering the needs and perspectives of all the stakeholders.
_   Software architecture typically have the following stakeholders:
    _Software developers: Software architecture helps developers create and evolve software by providing strong direction and organization on what needs to be done.
    _Project Managers: Software architecture provides useful information to project managers to help them identify possible risks and to manage the project successfully. Software architecture helps project managers to understand task dependencies and impacts of change and to coordinate work assignments.
    _Clients: Clients make important decisions about the system, like its funding. Software architecture establishes a basis for communication with clients, so they understand what they are paying for and that their needs are met.
    _End users: Users may not care how the software is actually designed, but they do care that it “works well” for them.
